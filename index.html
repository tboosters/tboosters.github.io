                    iClass Android Mobile Device Management (MDM) System was the main project in which I researched, designed and developed a server backend, a simple frontend webpage and an Android device policy controller app during my internship period in ITWakes Ltd. The system is now under further polishing and development by my ex-colleagues (many thanks to them!) and will be released soon.

                            <br>
                            The app performs 2 main tasks, namely device provisioning and device management: It provisions the device by exchanging information with the backend server, which delegates the provision request to Google, through HTTP requests. The device policies are then pushed to the device from the management backend by push messages, the controller decodes the message and perform the tasks accordingly.

                            Rather than rendering webpages with dynamic content on the server, the backend mainly serves as an API server providing endpoints for the clients like the frontend and the device manager to call. This isolates the design of the frontend from the backend and allows more efficient division of labour by letting the frontend engineer to take charge.
                            It also acts as a proxy to delegate valid user requests to the Google EMM API for app management actions.
                            <br>
                            I also employed some kind of JSON response format standard in all API responses to make cooperation between backend and frontend easier, sample:
                            <pre>
                                {

                                    "msg": "Success!",
                                    "data": "{"id":1, "text":"test"}"
                                }
                            </pre>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Server-side scripting: PHP5 in FuelPHP framework</li>

                        The app works with a backend API for sending requests and retrieving data. Self-implemented a JSONDownloader class for loading JSON data by sending requests to the backend. Used the external Glide library for image caching, resizing and reshaping in the Installed App fragment.

                                Written in Python3, used tkinter for GUI development
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Made use of an Iterative Deepening Search for expanding the game tree while controlling the depth of moves explored to prevent the player from waiting too long.

                            <li>
                                Made use of Alpha-Beta Pruning for pruning branches with non-feasible heuristics for the AI.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Designed the heuristics for calculating the score of each state as:
                                <pre>
                                    Piece difference + Corner Occupation + Corner Closeness + Mobility
                                </pre>
                                with higher weighting on corner occupation and mobility.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Features a GUI for player to interact with the chessboard directly and sees the latest count of chesses
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
